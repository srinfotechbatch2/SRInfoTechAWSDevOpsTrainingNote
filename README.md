Github Introduction::
===============

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, allowing developers to store and manage their code in repositories.

Version Control: ::
GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in code. This allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's contributions.

Repositories::: where you can store your project files and track the history of changes made to those files.Public and private repos can be created depending on accessibility needs.

Github Branching Model::
=======================

A GitHub branching model is a structured way of organizing branches in a Git repository to manage development workflows effectively. It helps teams work collaboratively, isolate features, manage releases, and deploy code more efficiently.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b5b48a9-9236-444e-a990-b512bc5ff581)

Sample Repository Hello-World Project::
=========================================

https://github.com/srinfotechbatch2/SRINfotechDemo


Branches:
==========
main (or master): Always production-ready.

feature/*: Used for new features.

release/*: Prepares for a new production release.

main or master branch:: This is default branch and whenever we created the empty Repository by defauly main or master branche is created automatically.
main or master branch always stable and live code 

feature branch:: It could be a new feature, an improvement of existing features, bug fixes, or any other changes. A feature branch is a type of branch in Git typically used to develop new features for the software.feature branch will created from main or master OR feature branch created from latest release branch always based on the release cycle

formate:: feature/YYYY.MM.DD
 feature/2025.06.22

release branch:: Based on the release we have created release branch accourdingly and starts the next release cycle.
always release branch created from master only and master have stable and live code and post release we shold merged code changes to master branch only

release/2025.07.20

Automatically Discard Old Builds:::
==============================
To automate the process of discarding old builds, you can configure the job’s settings to automatically delete old builds based on criteria such as the number of builds to keep or the age of the builds.

Follow these steps:

Open the Jenkins job (project).
Click on Configure (on the left-hand side).
Scroll down to the Build Discarder section (usually under the Build Triggers section).
Check Discard old builds.
Specify the following options:
Max # of builds to keep: Set the maximum number of builds to keep.
Max days to keep builds: Set the maximum age for builds to keep.
Save the configuration by clicking Save.

Execute the Jobs in Parallel::
==============================


1.By Default execute the Jenkins build jobs are sequence way,one by one 

2.Don’t do 2 projects build parallel  this is real time scenario but we can do parallel builds as well one job

Jenkins build parallel setup

Go job ---> configure ----> Generall ---> Execute concurrent builds if necessary

Pipelines Introduction:::

A Jenkins pipeline is a series of automated steps or stages that define the process of continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) for your code. Jenkins, being a popular open-source automation server, uses pipelines to automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code.

There are two types of Jenkins pipelines:

1. Declarative Pipeline
2. Scripted Pipeline

1. Declarative Pipeline::
The declarative pipeline syntax is simpler and more structured. It's the recommended style for most users because it's easy to read and maintain

Create Pipeline Project::
=======================

Steps

Click +New Item


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43694be8-ac77-41a1-9d90-30175a91443f)

Enter the Project Name And Click OK

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b21659a3-ff70-46ff-86b0-7a965b48197a)

At General Section Provide the Description

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0c5db89-597c-439e-91e1-7722bd4d5467)


At Definition, We need to select the Pipeline Script 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9b35819-0b40-4d71-9678-949d35a4cd3e)



Here's an example of a simple declarative pipeline: Syntax

pipeline{

agent any

stages{

Stage ('Clone'){

steps{

// write code
}
}

Stage ('Build'){
steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

Stage ('Test'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}
Stage ('Execute test casea and get the results'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

Stage ('Generated Artifact'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

Stage ('Deploy'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

// write code

}

}

Please try to create one pipeline job in jenkinsfile and execute the below Declarative pipeline example:;


pipeline {

   agent any

    stages {
        stage('Clone') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/srinfotech7358/spring-petclinic.git'
            }
        }
        
          stage('Build') {
            steps {
               bat 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
          stage('Test') {
            steps {
               bat 'mvn test'
            }
        }
          
    }
}


Plugins::
===============

Plugins in Jenkins are essential components that extend its core functionality, allowing you to customize Jenkins to meet specific CI/CD needs. Jenkins has a vast plugin ecosystem that supports building, deploying, and automating software projects across various platforms and tools

Install Plugins in Jenkins::
==============================

Step-by-Step:
Log in to Jenkins as an administrator.

Navigate to Manage Jenkins (usually on the left sidebar).

Click on Manage Plugins.

(Image reference from Jenkins documentation)

Go to the Available tab.

Use the search box to find the plugin you want.

Check the box next to the plugin name.

Click:

Pipeline: Stage View::
=================

Pipeline: Stage View Plugin in Jenkins
The Pipeline: Stage View plugin is a visualization tool in Jenkins that allows users to see a graphical view of each stage in a pipeline. It provides a real-time and historical overview of pipeline execution per stage, making it easier to debug, monitor, and analyze performance.


Click the Build Now and we can triggered the pipeline

Key elements in the declarative pipeline:::
======================================
pipeline: This is the top-level structure.

agent: Specifies where the pipeline will run, such as on any available agent, a specific node, or a Docker container.

stages: Defines the different steps or stages in the pipeline (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy).

steps: Commands to be executed in each stage.

Tomcat Web Server: Introduction
=============================

Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is primarily used to serve Java applications and is one of the most popular servlet containers in the world.

Tomcat is an essential tool for anyone working with Java web applications. It provides a simple, reliable platform for deploying and managing Java Servlets and JSPs and is widely used in both development and production environments. Its ease of use, combined with powerful features and flexibility, makes it an ideal choice for many developers working on Java-based web applications.

Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container that is primarily used to serve Java-based web applications. It implements several Java EE (Enterprise Edition) specifications, such as Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and WebSocket, among others. Tomcat is often used to run Java applications on the web because it's lightweight, easy to configure, and widely supported.

Here are some key points about Tomcat:

1. **Servlet Container**: Tomcat is a servlet container, meaning it manages the lifecycle of Java Servlets, which are small Java programs that run on a web server.
  
2. **JSP Support**: Tomcat also supports JavaServer Pages (JSP), a technology that allows for embedding Java code within HTML pages.

3. **Configuration**: It’s highly configurable through XML files, like `server.xml` for server settings, `web.xml` for application settings, and others.

4. **Lightweight**: Unlike full-fledged application servers like WildFly (formerly JBoss) or GlassFish, Tomcat is primarily a servlet and JSP container, which makes it lighter and easier to deploy for simpler Java web applications.

5. **Performance**: It’s known for good performance in handling static content, making it a popular choice for Java web developers.

Integrating Tomcat with Jenkins is a common use case for automating the deployment of Java-based web applications. Jenkins can be set up to deploy a web application to a Tomcat server whenever a new build is triggered.

Prerequisites:

Apache Tomcat should be installed and running on your server.
Jenkins should be installed and running.

Steps to integrate Jenkins with Tomcat:

1. Install the "Deploy to Container" Plugin in Jenkins:
The easiest way to deploy to Tomcat from Jenkins is by using the Deploy to Container plugin. This plugin allows Jenkins to deploy WAR files to a Tomcat server.

Go to your Jenkins dashboard.
Click on Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
In the Available tab, search for Deploy to Container Plugin and install it.
Once installed, restart Jenkins to apply the plugin.

2. Configure Tomcat Server in Jenkins:
Now you need to tell Jenkins where your Tomcat server is running.

In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System.
Scroll down to the Deploy to container section.
Click Add Tomcat Server.

Provide the necessary information:
Name: Give the Tomcat server a name (Tomcat9).
URL: The URL of your Tomcat server (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
Username: The username for Tomcat's manager app (usually admin).
Password: The password for that username (set in Tomcat's tomcat-users.xml).
Save the configuration.

3. Configure Tomcat’s tomcat-users.xml:
Make sure Tomcat is set up to allow Jenkins to deploy the application by editing the tomcat-users.xml file.

tomcat-users.xml file::
=========================

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61a0b6ae-1e6c-47d0-8852-b226d65f38a4)



  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <role rolename="manager-script"/>
  <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
  <role rolename="manager-status"/>
  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
  <role rolename="admin-script"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, manager-script, manager-jmx, manager-status, admin-gui, admin-script"/>




Restart Tomcat to apply the changes.

4. Create a Jenkins Job to Build and Deploy the Application:
Next, you need to create a Jenkins job that will build your web application (e.g., a WAR file) and deploy it to Tomcat.

From the Jenkins dashboard, click New Item.

Select Freestyle Project, give it a name, and click OK.

In the job configuration, go to the Build section and configure your build step, such as building a Maven project For Maven, you can use:

> mvn clean install

In the Post-build Actions section, add Deploy war/ear to a container.

In the WAR/EAR files field, provide the path to your WAR file (e.g., target/my-app.war).
In the Container field, choose the Tomcat server you configured earlier.
Set the Context Path (e.g., IfocusAWSDevOpsTraining), which is the URL path where the application will be accessible on Tomcat.
If you want Jenkins to deploy automatically after every successful build, check the option Deploy after every successful build.
Save the job.

5. Trigger the Build and Deployment:
Go to the Jenkins job you just created and click Build Now to trigger a build.
After the build completes, Jenkins should deploy the WAR file to your Tomcat server.

You can access your application by going to http://<tomcat_host>:<tomcat_port>/<context_path>

example::  http://localhost:8080/IfocusApplication/

POLL SCM:: * * * * * (every minute automatic build & deployment happend when new commits happend in github)
This setup will allow Jenkins to automatically build and deploy your Java web application to Tomcat with each new build


Polling SCM (Source Code Management) and webhooks are two common methods used for integrating continuous integration (CI) systems or automating tasks based on changes in repositories.

1. Polling SCM
Polling SCM is a method where a system (like Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.) periodically checks the source code repository for changes. If it detects changes, it triggers the build process or some other automated task.

How it works:

A job is set up to check the SCM (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) at regular intervals (e.g., every minute or hour).

The CI server pulls the repository to see if there are any new commits since the last poll.

If changes are detected, it triggers the CI/CD pipeline to build, test, or deploy the application.

2. Webhooks
Webhooks provide a more efficient method for triggering actions based on changes in the repository. Rather than the CI system polling for changes, the source control platform sends an HTTP POST request (webhook) to the CI system when an event (like a commit or pull request) occurs.
